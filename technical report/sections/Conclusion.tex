\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
In this project, we studied the main challenges of distributed databases in the context of IoT systems, and we designed and implemented a simple distributed database. Since performance is essential in IoT, we implemented our project in both C++ and Python and compared their resulting performance. Our experiments show that the optimal choice of a runtime system heavily depends on the type of application. For example, for our client implementation, CPython--an interpreter for the Python language--outperforms PyPy--a just-in-time compiler.
