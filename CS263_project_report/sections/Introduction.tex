\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
In a fast-growing universe of IoT devices, we are collectively trying to capture fine-grained, continuous data from IoT devices because such data enables more solid and useful analyses. However, many IoT applications rely on small, non-rechargeable batteries, and reducing the operations overhead on devices is very important. There are two significant challenges with IoT in the cloud: The rapid growth of data and the lack of IoT data security. In this project, we addressed these two main issues by developing a secure and distributed database for IoT systems.
