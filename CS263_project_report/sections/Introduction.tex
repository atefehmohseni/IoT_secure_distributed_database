\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
 Weâ€™re collectively trying to capture fine-grained, ongoing data from a fast-growing universe of IoT devices because the more data, the better the analyses are possible from that data. On the other hand, many IoT applications rely on small, non-rechargeable batteries, so reducing the operations overhead on devices is very important. So there are two major challenges with IoT in the cloud: The rapid growth of data, and the lack of IoT data security. In this project we tried to addressed these two main issues by developing a secure and distributed database for IoT systems.
