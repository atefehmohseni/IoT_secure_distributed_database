\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
In this project, we studied the main challenges of distributed databases in the context of IoT systems, and we designed and implemented a simple distributed database. Since performance is essential in IoT, we implemented our project in C++ and Python to compare their resulting performance. Our experiments clearly show that the choice of runtime system depends on the type of application. For example, for our client implementation, CPython--a mixed-mode runtime system--outperforms PyPy--a  just-in-time compiler.
