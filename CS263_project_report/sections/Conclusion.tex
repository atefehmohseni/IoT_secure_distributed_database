\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
In this project we learnt about multi-layer design implementation in IoT systems and main challenges of distributed databases. Since, the performance is important in IoT we implemented our project both in C++ and Python to closely evaluate the difference. We learnt that the choice of runtime system is dependent on the type of application. For instance, since there was no loop or repetition in our code, CPython- a mixed mode runtime system outperforms PyPy -a  just-in-time compilation.
